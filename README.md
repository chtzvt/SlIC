# SlIC
SlIC, or Slack Internet Control, is an extensible framework to send commands and retrieve metrics from your Linux servers. It is based on an earlier project, [simple-slack-IRC-bot](https://github.com/ctrezevant/simple-slack-IRC-bot), but it 
does away with IRC in favor of the more robust and easier to implement [Slack RTM API](https://api.slack.com/rtm). 

Full documentation is forthcoming, but the code is well-commented and should be easy to follow, for the most part. Any questions can be directed to a [new issue](https://github.com/ctrezevant/SlIC/issues/new) or to my [email](https://www.ctis.me), where I'll be happy to answer them. 

Enjoy!
